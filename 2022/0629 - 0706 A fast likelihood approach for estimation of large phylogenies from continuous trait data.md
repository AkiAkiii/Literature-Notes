# Overview

## Method Mechanism

The approximation works by first computing the maximum likelihood estimates of some internal branch lengths, and then inferring the tree-topology using these estimates

## Fill in gap: 
more computationally efficient than existing methods for such data while still achieving comparable accuracy

## Innovation:
use of the mathematical properties of tree-topologies for inference, and thus serves as a useful addition to the collection of methods available for estimating phylogenies from continuous trait data.

## 1. what is 'continuous trait data'?

A continuous trait displays a range of expression (such as weight, height, etc.) rather than an all-or-none appearance (such as white or red). Continuous traits are usually under polygenic control and subject to substantial environmental influence in expression.

## 2. what is 'allele frequency data'?

An allele frequency is calculated by dividing the number of times the allele of interest is observed in a population by the total number of copies of all the alleles at that particular genetic locus in the population. Allele frequencies can be represented as a decimal, a percentage, or a fraction.

Allele: one of two or more alternative forms of a gene that arise by mutation and are found at the same place on a chromosome.

## 3. Multivariate normal distribution (joint normal distribution)

a random vector is said to be k-variate normally distributed if every linear combination of its k components has a univariate normal distribution. Its importance derives mainly from the multivariate central limit theorem. The multivariate normal distribution is often used to describe, at least approximately, any set of (possibly) correlated real-valued random variables each of which clusters around a mean value.

## 5. What is 'most recent common ancestor (MRCA)' ?

## 6. What is taxa?
