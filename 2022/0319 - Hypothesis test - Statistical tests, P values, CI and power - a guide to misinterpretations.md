# Intro

# Main



# Concepts

1. P value

 - Simple: P value is the probability that the test statistic would be the observed value if the null hypothesis was true.

 - Complete: The P value is the probability that the chosen test statistic would have been at least as large as its observed value if every model
assumption were correct, including the test hypothesis.

2. Significance level \alpha

 - Simple: \alpha is the cut-off value, which means when P value =< \alpha, the results are 'statistically significant'. 

 - Complete: the P value is degraded into a dichotomy in which results are declared 'statistically
significant' if P falls on or below a cut-off (usually 0.05) and declared 'nonsignificant' otherwise. The terms 'significance level’ and ‘alpha level’ (a) are often used to
refer to the cut-off.

# Notes
1. Difference between 'P value' and 'Significant level'

 - the cut-off value a is supposed to be fixed in advance and is thus part of the study
design, unchanged in light of the data. In contrast, the P value is a number computed from the data and thus an
analysis result, unknown until it is computed.
