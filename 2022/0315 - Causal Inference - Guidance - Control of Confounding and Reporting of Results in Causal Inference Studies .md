# Intro

# Main

## Key Principle #1: Causal Inference Requires Careful Consideration of Confounding

how one should define and select confounders in observational studies that attempt to make causal inferences?

### - Historical Approach

### - Using Causal Models

### - Not recommand

- P value- or model-based methods
- Methods based on $\beta$ -coefficient changes
-  Selection of variables to identify “independent predictors”

## Key Principle #2: Interpretation of results should not rely on the magnitude of P values

- P values should rarely be presented in isolation
- Present effect estimates and measures of variability with or without P values
- Variability around effect estimates should inform conclusions
- A conclusion of “no association” should require exclusion of meaningful effect sizes
- Avoid the word “significant” in favor of more specific language.

## Key Principle #3: Results should be presented in a granular and transparent fashion

- Use the STROBE statement and checklist
- Model tables after the STROBE explanation and elaboration document (30)
- Visual presentation of quantitative results
- Present individual data points when possible 
- Avoid excessive lines, text, grids, and abbreviations 
- Continuous data should not be presented in bar charts with standard error bars (“plunger plots”) 
- Use color-blind–friendly palettes

# Concepts

1. STROBE (Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology) : A statement of guidance on how to report the results of human observational studies that test causal associations.


causal association:
causal effect:

# Notes
1. Difference between 'causal inference' and 'prediction modeling'
