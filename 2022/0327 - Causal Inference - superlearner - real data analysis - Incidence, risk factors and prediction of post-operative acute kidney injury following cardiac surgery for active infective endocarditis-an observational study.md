# Intro

the study was to determine the risk factors for post-operative AKI in patients operated on for IE.

Y is categorical, which is the primary outcome was post-operative AKI, defined as the development of AKI or progression of AKI based on the acute kidney injury network (AKIN) definition.

- used ensemble machine learning (“Super Learning”) to develop a predictor of AKI based on potential risk factors

- evaluated its performance using V-fold cross validation. (CV package?)
 
- identified clinically important predictors among a set of risk factors using Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimation. (How to conduct this risk factor selecting?)

# Methods (statistical analysis)

## super learner 


# Notes
1. Difference between 'causal inference' and 'prediction modeling'
