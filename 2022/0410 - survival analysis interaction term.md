# Intro

To demonstrate the adverse impact of ignoring statistical interactions in regression
models used in epidemiologic studies. Specifically, we
studied the effect of ignoring interactions in a Cox proportional hazards regression model.

Using simulation and one real life data.

-Misspecified models without interaction terms resulted in up to 8.95 fold bias in estimated regression coefficients.

-for perfect Cox Ph model, only 2% estimated bias in main effect regression coefficients estimates. 

Question:

- (what is the meaning of 'main effect regression coefficients estimates'?)

- what is the meaning of this result: 'but did not alter
the main findings of no significant interactions'

## The importance of identified interaction term



# Methods (statistical analysis)

# Notes:

1. these words often means same thing
interaction effect, effect modification, or effect-measure modification

-epidemiologic prospective: effect modification refers to a situation where the effect
of one predictor variable (e.g., exposure) on the outcome is dependent on the values of some
other covariates

-statistical prospective: fit by including the **product of two or more predictor variables** along with
their **corresponding individual variables** in regression models. (Model with interaction term must also contain the individual var in the interaction term)xue
